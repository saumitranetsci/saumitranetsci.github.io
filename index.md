<img align="right"  width="225" height="225" src="images/netsi_photo_1.jpeg">

Saumitra is a PhD student in the [Social Urban Networks Lab](https://www.socialurban.net/) (SUNLab) at Northeastern University’s [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) (NetSI), working with [Prof. Esteban Moro](http://estebanmoro.org/). His research focuses on understanding human behavior in urban environments using large-scale smartphone behavioral data, leveraging tools from [computational social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science) and [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) to inform better policy design in cities.

His past work spans a broad range of domains, with a consistent focus on network science. He has explored diverse applications—from dynamical processes on networks and computational biology to financial systems and even culinary science.

Prior to joining NetSI, Saumitra was a Lagrange Fellow at the [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it/) in Turin, Italy, where he worked in collaboration with [UNICEF Frontier Data Network](https://data.unicef.org/frontier-data-network/) on reducing bias in behavioral data for displacement monitoring in natural disaster response.

He has also held research positions at the [Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.imsc.res.in/) and the [Department of Scientific Computing, Modeling and Simulation](https://scms.unipune.ac.in/) (SCMS) at [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) (SPPU) in India. He holds a Master’s degree in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation from SCMS-SPPU.
